A database in SQL Oracle where users insert tasks to do.

- Firstly, an user has to create a login in which the username is automatically assigned 
- They have the ability to work alone or in groups.
- Tasks can have deadlines, they can be recurring tasks or both (or none).
- Users can participate in score programs in which every task done or undone adds or substracts points from the score. The number of points are depending on the category of the task.

This program isn't quite ready for practical use or to showcase my skills. However, by making it visible to the public, I can present the work I've done at the university.
